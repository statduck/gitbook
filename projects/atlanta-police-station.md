# Atlanta Police Station

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png>)

* **Course**: CX4242 in Fall 2021 Georgia Tech
* **Topic**: We recommend the location and the staff composition of Atlanta police station.
* **Approach**: We cluster neighborhoods by several data and re-clustered our results based on the locations of our cluster results. Based on this result, we solve an optimization problem with finding an optimal location for Atlanta police station. Making use of the difference among clusters, we also suggest optimal staff composition by each station.
* **Role**: I combined the crime data, demographic data, and car crash data for clustering. I found police officers spend time related with car crash in a research, so I mix up several data set for clustering. I evaluated our model by comparing the distance from the location to the crime locations for each zone. Our model reduces average distance by 31%.

Evaluation:&#x20;

* **Period**: 2021.09 - 2021.12
