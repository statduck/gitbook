# Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning

&#x20;The supervised learning is a density estimation problem related with determining the properties of $$P(Y|X)$$.&#x20;

$$
\mu(x) =argmin_\theta E_{Y|X} L(Y,\theta)
$$

Unsupervised Learning

Unlike the supervised learning, unsupervised learning directly infers the properties of $$P(X)$$ without the help of a supervisor($$Y$$).
